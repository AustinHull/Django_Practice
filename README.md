Be advised, this repo does not include various "venv" (virtual environment) or app-specific "settings.py" app information and parameters. This is to allow for a relatively brief project repository, allowing users to pull content into properly-generated Django apps on their respective, local developer environments. To reiterate, the end-user or peer-contributor must set up a local Django project on their own respective system, before attempting to synchronize their working environment with the basic app-example assets included within this repository.
